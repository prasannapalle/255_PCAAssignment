 ## 1) visualization of class1 and class2 onto 3D plot

 ## 2) *How* do the covariance matrix and scatter matrix differ? 
 
 ## Answer
 ## --> we can also calculate covariance matrix instead of scatter matrix using numpy.cov() function.
 ## --> The equations for the covariance matrix and scatter matrix are very similar, but there is only one difference is, that we use the scaling factor 1/N-1 for the covariance matrix. thus, their eigen spaces will be identical.


## 3) Visualize the eigenvectors

## 4) Visualize the transformed data and add the labels (class_1 and class_2) using sklearn.decomposition import PCA as sklearnPCA
